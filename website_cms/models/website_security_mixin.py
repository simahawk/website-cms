# replace sql query and secure model stuff with access rules

        and `view_group_ids`.

        The goal is to hide items that current user cannot see
        in the frontend (like navigation, listings)
        and, why not, even in the backend.

        Here if we find a contraint on any group
        we filter out what the current user cannot view.

        Disclaimer: yes, we could use `ir.rule`s for this
        but since we want the end user to select a group
        easily without having to get in touch w/ rules,
        we chosed this way.

        To use `ir.rule` we'd need to extend them
        w/ a relation to real objects and put our hands
        inside rules computation, and keep user settings
        in sync with rules, etc, etc.
        The computation of the domain for a rule,
        applies only to groups associated to current user.
        We want the other way around: apply permission check
        to make sure that if a user does not belong
        to a specific group, he/she cannot see the item.
        Hence, you must define a global rule and add it
        a new field for a groups, and then mess around
        w/ domain computation.

        As of today, this is still a prototype
        and we might change/improve this check ;)

        Finally, the `SecureModelConverter` base klass
        is using `exists` to check if the item exists.
        This method in turns does not check for security.
        Hence, we are trying to use the same mechanism
        for both cases.
